            <p>
                 we have used the Rainfall dataset in India from the Kaggle for predicting the
                rainfall at different parts of the country at a particular time based upon the seasons. Granularity is on a
                monthly basis and this data is taken from 36- meteorological subdivisions located in India, where the
                amount of rainfall is being measured in Millimeters(mm).Using Machine Learning(ML) models we
                have predicted the future rainfall of India in different places.
            </p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
<p>
    In our project, we have used machine learning algorithms such as linear regression/logistic regression,
    support vector machine (SVM), matplotlib for plotting the graphs.
</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Linear/Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>
    
Linear regression is used to determine or identify the relationships between two
columns/variables in a dataset. Logistic regression is used for analyzing a dataset that has one
independent variable or more. The results obtained from analyzing the variables are either 0s
or 1s/true or false.

</p>
<h2 class="sub-title"> Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h2>
<p>
    
   
The support vector machine is used for classification between any set of groups present in the
dataset. The objective of the SVM is to draw the best fit line which is used to differentiate
between two different classes or groups present in the dataset.
    
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Matplotlib</h2>
    <p>
        
        Matplotlib is the library which can be used for creating visualization by plotting graphs
        where we can differentiate the rainfall rate based on states when the rain occurs & further
        differentiates the quantity of the rainfall of each city at each month
        
        </p>

<h2 class="title">Hardware Modules</h2>
<p>
    
    The required hardware modules are the sensors, microcontroller and the materials for
    power supply. The objective of these hardware components is to control and measure the
    pressure of water. It collects the data on water level and the information is stored in the cloud
    through the communication of WIFI and the data is being enabled to pass the information
    through the internet.
</p>


<h2 class="sub-title">Microcontroller</h2>
    <p>
        The microcontroller helps in processing the information which is being fetched
from the sensors and this information is being sent to the admin through
the medium of the cloud
        </p>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Sensors</h2>
    <p>
        
        The sensors which help to give the information to the microcontroller from various
        nodes located at a different place. The sensors that are required for this project are as follows:
        <b style="color: rgb(230, 99, 12);">The ultrasonic sensor</b>-This sensor is used to measure the level of the water and the
        average rainfall that is being occurred at a particular place. If water level strikes at a
        particular level it emits very high frequency so these echo signals are reflected in the sensors
        and it gives an alert message to the microcontroller and send the information to the cloud.
        <b style="color: rgb(230, 99, 12);" >The ultrasonic sensor</b> consists of 4-pin. The 4-pins are used to measure water level, trigger,
        ground connection & the last current.
        <b style="color: rgb(230, 99, 12);">Pressure sensor</b> - BMP Barometric sensor is used to identify the atmospheric pressure
        present inside the water.
        <b style="color: rgb(230, 99, 12);">Humidity sensor</b> - DHT11 sensor works on the principle of one wire protocol which
        identifies the climatic changes and the humidity which gives us the output in a digital format.
        </p>
       

<h2 class="sub-title"> Power Supply</h2>
    <p>
        High energy of power supply is not needed, so the current we get in the AC power
supply is being converted to the DC power supply and it can be used in the implementation.
        </p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Database Module</h2>
<p>
    The values that are being fetched by the microcontrollers from the sensors are sent to
    the cloud via WIFI. The cloud will have the access of all the registered users. This stored
    data is being redirected to the websites where the users can access the information about the
    condition of flood occurring .
